# miniproxy
A minimalistic proxy. Self contained and written in python-tornado.

I had an idea, why not take pics of the website and send them!?
along with the standard send the html as text and take the href=<external shit> off.
it is a infaluable way of getting info in to networks that enable internet acess but not certain sites. if you only want info.
you can get that.
if you need to visualize, the proxy take pics of the site and send them.
if you want to access stuff that are not available for your region, put the proxy in another country and get info as if you where acessing from there.


it is all TODO for now.
